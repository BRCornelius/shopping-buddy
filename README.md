# Shopping Buddy
While stuck at home for COVID, my 4-year-old daughter was always secretly listening to my wife and I discuss from which stores we were ordering our groceries and food. Now, if I am talking to myself and say something like, "I really want a poboy," she will immediately say, "You should go to Zimmers." She is my little shopping buddy, and that is what we are building here. This chrome extension will gently remind our partners' users that they can fulfill their travel booking needs using points through our partners rather than dollars.
